To build this program, I wrote down a function to compute the cost at the beginning. 
Besides the user input (price, number of people, product name), an implicit information, the corresponding markup of product is required. 
To solve this problem, I used 2 HashMaps to save pairs of product-category, and category-markup.
And these information is store in 2 files. 
An extra function of my code is that user can create new product-category pair if the input product can not be found in the file.
